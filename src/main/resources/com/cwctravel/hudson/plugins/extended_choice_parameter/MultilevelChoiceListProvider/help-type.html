    The type of parameter:
    <ul>
        <li>Multi-Level Single Select: user chooses a selection from a drop down, and then a another drop down appears
            with selections that depend on the first value, and upon second selection a third drop down may appear
            depending on the first two selections, and so on.<br><br>
            The property file is a tab delimited file, with levels defined in columns and choices defined in rows. For
            example, to have a 2 level selection where you first select a country and then a city, you could specify a
            file such as the following:<br><br>
            <pre>
Country             City
United States       San Francisco
United States       Chicago
Mexico              Mexico City
Mexico              Cancun
            </pre>
            <pre>

            </pre>
            This would result in a first drop down with the options "Select a country...", "United States", and "Mexico"
            (the initial selection is "Select a country...", which serves as a label for the drop down). After the user
            selects a country, a "City" drop down would appear. If United States was chosen first, then San Francisco
            and Chicago would be options, but if Mexico was selected then instead Mexico City and Cancun would be
            options.
            <br><br>
            The columns that should represent levels must be specified in the value field. For example "Country,City"
            could be valid values.
            <br><br>
            Note that default values are not supported for multi-level selects.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Multi-Level Multi Select: same as single select, but after all levels are chosen, a button appears to
            "Select another..." and an additional multi-level selection is presented.
    </ul>
</div>
